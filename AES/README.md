The ***Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)*** is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Here are the steps involved in the AES encryption process:

Key Expansion: The input key is transformed into several round keys through a process called key expansion. This step is necessary because the key is used in every round of the encryption process, and the key size is smaller than the block size.

# Initial Round: 
The plaintext block is XORed with the first round key to produce the intermediate state.

# Round Function: 
The intermediate state is passed through a series of rounds, each of which consists of four steps:

# Substitute Bytes: 
The bytes of the intermediate state are replaced with new values using a lookup table called the S-box.

# Shift Rows: 
The rows of the intermediate state are shifted cyclically by different offsets.

# Mix Columns: 
The columns of the intermediate state are transformed using a matrix multiplication.

# Add Round Key: 
The round key is XORed with the intermediate state.

# Final Round: 
The final round is similar to the previous rounds, except that it does not include the Mix Columns step.

# Output Transformation: 
The intermediate state from the final round is passed through an additional set of transformations to produce the final ciphertext.

## Here is an example of the AES encryption process written in pseudo-code:

Copy code
```
def AES_encrypt(plaintext, key):
  # Initialize variables
  state = plaintext
  round_key = key_expansion(key)

  # Initial round
  state = state XOR round_key[0]

  # Rounds
  for i in range(1, Nr):
    state = round_function(state, round_key[i])

  # Final round
  state = final_round(state, round_key[Nr])

  # Output transformation
  ciphertext = output_transformation(state)

  return ciphertext
```
Here, Nr is the number of rounds and round_function() and final_round() are functions that perform the operations of the round function.
